# COPILOT EDITS OPERATIONAL GUIDELINES

## PRIME DIRECTIVE
- Avoid working on more than one file at a time.
- Multiple simultaneous edits to a file will cause corruption.
- Be chatting and teach about what you are doing while coding.
- Follow KISS principle (Keep It Simple, Stupid) and DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself).
- All source code MUST be written in English, including comments, variable names, function names, and documentation.
- All source code is in src folder. src folder is the only folder that will be copied to the docker image. 
- Use src as source code base folder. All imports should be relative to src folder.


## Command Line Interface (CLI) information
- Use **Click** library for CLI commands.
- CLI commands are located in `src/commands/` folder.
- Each command should have its own file in the `src/commands/` folder.
- The main CLI entry point is `src/cli.py`.
- The CLI commands should be registered in the `src/commands/__init__.py` file.
- The base path for cli scripts is `src/`
- use `cd src/` before running any CLI command.
- Use `python cli.py <command> <args>` to run CLI commands.

## LANGUAGE REQUIREMENTS - CRITICAL
- **ALL code comments, docstrings, and documentation MUST be written in English**
- **Variable names, function names, and identifiers MUST use English**
- **Error messages and log messages MUST be in English**
- **This applies regardless of the conversation language with the user**
- **Never translate technical terms or use mixed languages in code**
- **When user speaks in Spanish/other languages, respond in their language but keep ALL code in English**

## LARGE FILE & COMPLEX CHANGE PROTOCOL

### MAKING EDITS
- Focus on one conceptual change at a time
- Show clear "before" and "after" snippets when proposing changes
- Include concise explanations of what changed and why
- Always check if the edit maintains the project's coding style
- **Language**: All code comments and explanations MUST be in English

### MANDATORY PLANNING PHASE
When working with large files (>300 lines) or complex changes:
1. ALWAYS start by creating a detailed plan BEFORE making any edits
2. Your plan MUST include:
   - All functions/sections that need modification
   - The order in which changes should be applied
   - Dependencies between changes
   - Estimated number of separate edits required

3. Format your plan as:
## PROPOSED EDIT PLAN
Working with: [filename]
Total planned edits: [number]

### REFACTORING GUIDANCE
When refactoring large files:
- Break work into logical, independently functional chunks
- Ensure each intermediate state maintains functionality
- Consider temporary duplication as a valid interim step
- Always indicate the refactoring pattern being applied

### Edit sequence:
1. [First specific change] - Purpose: [why]
2. [Second specific change] - Purpose: [why]
3. Do you approve this plan? I'll proceed with Edit [number] after your confirmation.
4. WAIT for explicit user confirmation before making ANY edits when user ok edit [number]

### EXECUTION PHASE
- After each individual edit, clearly indicate progress:
  "✅ Completed edit [#] of [total]. Ready for next edit?"
- If you discover additional needed changes during editing:
- STOP and update the plan
- Get approval before continuing

## CODE COMMENT EXAMPLES (ENFORCE ENGLISH)

### ✅ CORRECT - English Comments
```php
/**
 * Calculates the total price including taxes
 * @param float $basePrice The base price before taxes
 * @return float The final price with taxes included
 */
function calculateTotalPrice(float $basePrice): float {
    // Apply standard tax rate of 21%
    return $basePrice * 1.21;
}
```

### ❌ INCORRECT - Spanish Comments
```php
/**
 * Calcula el precio total incluyendo impuestos
 * @param float $basePrice El precio base antes de impuestos
 * @return float El precio final con impuestos incluidos
 */
function calculateTotalPrice(float $basePrice): float {
    // Aplicar tasa de impuesto estándar del 21%
    return $basePrice * 1.21;
}
```

- Differentiate among:
- **Network errors** (e.g., timeouts, server errors, rate-limiting)
- **Functional/business logic errors** (logical missteps, invalid user input, validation failures)
- **Runtime exceptions** (unexpected errors such as null references)
- Provide **user-friendly** error messages (e.g., "Something went wrong. Please try again shortly.") and log more technical details to dev/ops (e.g., via a logging service).
- Consider a central error handler function or global event (e.g., `window.addEventListener('unhandledrejection')`) to consolidate reporting.
- Carefully handle and validate JSON responses, incorrect HTTP status codes, etc.

- Be sure to consider the following aspects:
  - Code Injection: Check for potential code injection vulnerabilities (SQL, XSS, etc.). Especially not using bind parameters with SQL queries.
  - Handling of Sensitive Data: Ensure that sensitive data is properly protected and cannot be extracted without being logged.
  - Input Validation: Verify that all user inputs are correctly validated.
  - Secure Coding Practices: Observe if secure coding best practices are followed.
  - Code changes do not introduce any security vulnerabilities or bypass security checks
